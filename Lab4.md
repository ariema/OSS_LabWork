## 2. Choosing a License:

It is important to choose a license so that other people know what they can and cannot do with your code. If you do not have a license, the default copyright laws apply, which state that no one can reproduce or change your work. Thus, without a license it is impossible for a project to be truly open source.

## 3. Dont use a project without a license:

If a project does not have a license it is unknown what the user is allowed to do with it. Thus it is dangerous to copy this code because you could get sued since the project may be under default copyright laws. Thus no license does not imply that it is free to use and edit, conversely it implies the opposite.
