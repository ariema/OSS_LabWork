## 2. Choosing a License:

It is important to choose a license so that other people know what they can and cannot do with your code. If you do not have a license, the default copyright laws apply, which state that no one can reproduce or change your work. Thus, without a license it is impossible for a project to be truly open source.

## 3. Dont use a project without a license:

If a project does not have a license it is unknown what the user is allowed to do with it. Thus it is dangerous to copy this code because you could get sued since the project may be under default copyright laws. Thus no license does not imply that it is free to use and edit, conversely it implies the opposite.

## 4. Why the Web beat Gopher:

## 7. Licenses:
### 1. GPL
GPL license allows you to copy, distribute, and modify the software as long as you track changes. Also any changes made must also be made available under the GPL license. This license it good for the greater good because everyone can collaborate and it creates a sense of community.

### 2. LPGL
LPGL licenses are usually applied to libraries. Any derivate works can only be redistributed under LGPL, but applications that use the new software do not have to be. This license aligns with businesses because it would allow them to build proprietary software on top of libraries which are open source.

### 3. Apache/BSD
Apache License doesnâ€™t require you to release the modified code under the same license. Additionally, Apache has restrictions on trademark use. I think developers would like this license because it offers the most freedom and allows developers to do as they please with the software.
